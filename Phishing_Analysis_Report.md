## 📧 Phishing Indicators Found in FedEx Email Sample

- **Sender's Email Domain:**  
  The sender address `TrackingUpdates@emails-track.com` is **not an official FedEx domain** (FedEx usually uses `@fedex.com`), which is suspicious.

- **Urgent Language:**  
  The email uses pressure tactics like *“If we do not receive a response the package will be returned to sender”* to provoke quick action.

- **Unverified Link:**  
  The “Manage Delivery” link could hide a phishing destination. Always hover over the link before clicking.

- **Delivery Issues as Bait:**  
  Phishing emails often fake delivery problems because people don’t want to miss their packages.

- **No Personalization or Correct Details:**  
  The email says “Hi, Demo.” — generic greeting often used in phishing emails.

✅ **Conclusion:**  
This is a classic phishing attempt disguised as a FedEx delivery notice, attempting to trick the recipient into clicking a malicious link.
